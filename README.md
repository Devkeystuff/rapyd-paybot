We empower Discord communities through payments directly in Discord.

### Motivation

Managing finances is not an easy task (what a surprise ðŸ˜ƒ). 
Even if it is just a simple paid event in Discord, paid roles or a marketplace which sells real products, some steps must be taken in order to provide server members a comfortable payment experience.

With Rapyd Paybot there is no more hustle! Integrate the bot into your existing community and enjoy easy, fast and secure payments directly withnin Discord.
